It's possible that apps in these latter categories appeal to smaller but more specific and engaged user bases, resulting in higher ratings despite receiving fewer ratings overall. Additionally, it could also be that the apps that have more rating tend to be more popular, but that doesn't mean that it's the best app, it's just more known. \n",
